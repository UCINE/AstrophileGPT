# AstrophileGPT
this is a versatile chatbot AI, adaptable to various applications. This implementation integrates two language models: OpenAI and Cohere. While the Cohere model is freely available, it requires precise training instructions to achieve optimal performance. For those with access to the OpenAI API, simply uncomment the relevant section in the server-side code and input your API key into the .env file. Currently, the user interface is basic, featuring a simple HTML page for testing. Plans for future development include aesthetic enhancements and additional features. Contributions and pull requests are highly encouraged.
